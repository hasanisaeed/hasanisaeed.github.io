## درباره من

As a **co-founder and board member** of Ryca, I leverage over *12 years of programming expertise*, underscored by a *Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence (AI)* and proficiency in *Python and C*. Since Ryca's inception in **January 2020, in Shahrud County, Semnan, Iran**, my journey has been defined by pivotal roles that blend hands-on software development with strategic oversight. My leadership in engineering robust *frontend and backend systems*, alongside managing a comprehensive *transportation management system for over 5,000 drivers nationwide*, demonstrates a commitment to innovation and excellence. My technical skills, coupled with a disciplined, hard-working ethos, have been instrumental in driving Ryca's success and in navigating the complexities of AI and software development.
